# 🍎 Automatic AI-Based Fruit Identification using CNN

## 📘 Project Overview
This project presents an **automated fruit classification system** powered by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning**.  
It utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to identify and classify different types of fruits from images with high accuracy.

The system is integrated into a **web application** using the **Django framework**, allowing users to upload fruit images and instantly receive predictions with confidence levels.

## 🧩 Model Architecture
The CNN model was designed to automatically learn visual features from fruit images.  
It includes:
- **Convolutional layers** for feature extraction  
- **Pooling layers** for dimensionality reduction  
- **Dropout** to prevent overfitting  
- **Dense layers** for classification  
- **Softmax output layer** for multi-class prediction  

> The model achieved a **validation accuracy of ~84%** using the Fruit Image Dataset.
